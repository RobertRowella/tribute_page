This is the first project withing freecodecamps HTML/CSS. Took me a bit to overcome how to start it off but once I got into it I started learning more. This is still rough and as I learn more I will change it to make it better. I have learned a lot through this first project like how to style and what is good for doing said styles. Also helped me understand more of the div function.
